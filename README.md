This project's goal is to give you a chance to develop your C2Explorer query locally, on your computer.

You can't *see* generated charts or tables on your computer for now, but you can use Console.WriteLine for debugging purposes or do whatever you want with C2Explorer data.
And IntelliSense will help you a lot....

To be able to use this project, you need a static IP address and a login/password generated on the Collective2 side.

Send me your IP address and I will send you your credentials.


### This project is NOT officially supported by Collective2.

If you have any question, send it to my e-mail bob@collective2.com.

Sincerely,
Bohuslav Svancara
